The aim of the research is to draw attention of the educational community to the phenomenon of computational thinking which actively discussed in the last decade in the foreign scientific and educational literature, to substantiate of its importance, practical utility and the right on affirmation in Russian education. Methods. The research is based on the analysis of foreign studies of the phenomenon of computational thinking and the ways of its formation in the process of education; on comparing the notion of <<computational thinking>> with related concepts used in the Russian scientific and pedagogical literature. Results. The concept <<computational thinking>> is analyzed from the point of view of intuitive understanding and scientific and applied aspects. It is shown as computational thinking has evolved in the process of development of computers hardware and software. The practice-oriented interpretation of computational thinking which dominant among educators is described along with some ways of its formation. It is shown that computational thinking is a metasubject result of general education as well as its tool. From the point of view of the author, purposeful development of computational thinking should be one of the tasks of the Russian education. Scientific novelty. The author gives a theoretical justification of the role of computational thinking schemes as metasubject results of learning. The dynamics of the development of this concept is described. This process is connected with the evolution of computer and information technologies as well as increase of number of the tasks for effective solutions of which computational thinking is required. Author substantiated the affirmation that including <<computational thinking >> in the set of pedagogical concepts which are used in the national education system fills an existing gap. Practical significance. New metasubject result of education associated with the formation of personal and professional qualities the persons living and working in the information society is formulated.

"This This book is open access under a CC BY 4.0 license. This book offers a comprehensive guide, covering every important aspect of computational thinking education. It provides an in-depth discussion of computational thinking, including the notion of perceiving computational thinking practices as ways of mapping models from the abstraction of data and process structures to natural phenomena. Further, it explores how computational thinking education is implemented in different regions, and how computational thinking is being integrated into subject learning in K-12 education. In closing, it discusses computational thinking from the perspective of STEM education, the use of video games to teach computational thinking, and how computational thinking is helping to transform the quality of the workforce in the textile and apparel industry.

"Abstract Computers and smart devices have become ubiquitous staples of our lives. Computers and computer-controlled devices are used in all industries from medicine to engineering, and textile production. One field where computers have inevitably spread into is education, and one pre-requisite of controlling computers, or increasing the level and efficiency of our control over them, is making human-computer interaction as efficient as possible. This process of efficient and effective computer use, known as ""Computer-like Thinking"" or ""Computational Thinking"", is seen as a field with the potential to support individual and societal development in our rapidly progressing world and to provide significant economic benefits. The fundamental concepts and scope of this field have been delineated in diverse manners by different researchers. Similarly, researchers have also advanced distinct critical viewpoints towards and potential benefits of computational thinking. This study aims to first define the concept of computational thinking by referencing source literature, then analyze the aims of certain criticisms of the field, and discuss the fundamental elements of computational thinking and contemporary research on these elements.","FK Cansu ,  SK Cansu  - ...
