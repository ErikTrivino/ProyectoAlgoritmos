N2  - Computational thinking refers to thinking and solving issues in the same way as computer scientists do. This study aims to evaluate the computational thinking skills of prospective elementary teachers. This study uses a quantitative descriptive research method. The research instrument uses a computational thinking skills test containing four indicators, namely decomposition, algorithm, pattern recognition, abstraction/generalization. The subjects of this study were 244 prospective elementary teachers from a Study Program of Elementary School Teacher Education at a public university in Pekanbaru, Riau, Indonesia. The results of this study indicate that the computational thinking skills of prospective elementary teachers are in the moderate category. Among the four indicators, prospective elementary teachers' skills of decomposition and pattern recognition are higher than algorithm and abstraction/generalization.

N2  - Teaching with educational robots is increasingly being integrated into the curriculum. However, many teachers, and especially those who have been in practice for a long time have not been trained in this area. Therefore, in-service teacher training in educational robotics is now an important area. In the framework of the Erasmus FERTILE project, materials on this topic have been developed. Based on these, teacher training is being implemented in several European countries in 2024. Participants are introduced to educational robotics in combination with arts, with a particular focus on the development of computational thinking skills. In this paper, we focus on the final part of the training, in which a peer assessment using a rubric was used to evaluate the projects created. We demonstrate the inter-rater reliability of the rubric applied and use the results of the peer assessment to verify the participants' level of understanding of computational thinking.

N2  - This feasibility study investigates the practicality of incorporating Computational Thinking (CT) education into secondary school curricula, aiming to equip students with essential 21st-century skills. The study assesses the readiness of educational institutions, teachers and students to embrace CT as an integral part of their learning journey, identifying potential challenges and barriers to successful implementation. To achieve these objectives, the research examines the existing landscape of CT education, evaluates teacher preparedness, analyses student receptiveness, and explores resource requirements and best practices from around the world. As part of this investigation, an immersive learning approach will be integrated. A five-day training program was implemented, featuring a comprehensive curriculum that covered key CT concepts, problem-solving techniques, presentation skills, and problem-based learning aligned with Sustainable Development Goals. The program included pre-and post-surveys to measure students' understanding of CT concepts and practical projects to apply their learning. Results showed consistent improvement in students' self-reported understanding of CT skills and their ability to apply these concepts to real-world problems. The study reveals that integrating CT into secondary education is not only necessary but also highly beneficial. The study emphasizes that a holistic educational reform incorporating leadership, technology and curriculum adjustments is essential for the successful implementation of CT education. The study also highlights the importance of aligning CT education with current educational policies and trends, such as KSSM (Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah -Secondary School Standard Curricular), which advocate for the inclusion of CT as a fundamental practice of science education. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights and recommendations for educational policymakers, administrators, and educators interested in enhancing CT skills in secondary students.
